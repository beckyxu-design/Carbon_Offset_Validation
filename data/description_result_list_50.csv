https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/4983,"The proposed project activity involves the installation of rooftop and ground mounted solar panels for captive consumption. The surplus electricity if generated can be supplied to the grid and if there is deficit of energy, that can be consumed from grid through a net metering arrangement with the respective state electricity board. The Net Metering concept states that the customers are to be charged only for the net power that they consume from the electricity service provider that has accumulated over a specific period. In other terms if the installed renewable energy produces more electricity than the consumed then the producer would be paid or credited for the excess amount of electricity generation to the grid over the same period. The Net Metering helps the grid to supply in the peak hours to keep up with increase demand in peak hours. It has been observed that in the actual scenario, no surplus power is exported to the grid as the internal demand of the premises is very high and the status quo is expected to be maintained throughout the operation of the projects. Hence, none of the instances export greater than 50% of generated electricity to the grid, so the project eligibility in the VCS program is justified. The geographical location of the project is entire India. The project activity will displace electricity from an electricity distribution system that is or would have been supplied by at least one fossil fuel fired generating unit i.e., in the absence of the project activity, the users would have been supplied electricity from one or more sources listed below: (a) A national or a regional grid (grid hereafter); (b) Fossil fuel fired captive power plant; (c) A carbon intensive mini-grid The baseline scenario would be either continued by use of fossil fuel dominated grid connected electricity generation or fossil fuel used in power plant or carbon intensive electricity.",4983
https://registry.verra.org/app/projectDetail/VCS/4984,"The projects primary objective is to change the pre-project/baseline scenario of the household cooking practices by replacing inefficient wood-fired mud stoves and three- stone stove technologies with clean, sustainable, and efficient biogas digestion unit and stoves. Each beneficiary household actively participates by utilizing cattle dung as the primary feed for the digesters, strategically curbing greenhouse gas emissions. This approach not only displaces conventional non-renewable biomass, such as firewood, with renewable biogas but also averts emissions of Methane (CH4) and Nitrogen Oxide (NO2) associated with the anaerobic decay of animal manure. Beyond emissions reduction, the initiative plays a pivotal role in enhancing rural hygiene practices through the proper disposal of animal waste. Furthermore, the residue derived from the bio-digesters is repurposed as organic fertilizer, contributing to sustainable land applications. By replacing non-renewable energy sources with biogas generated from the biodigesters, the project aligns with the broader goals of sustainable development outlined by the United Nations.",4984

The proposed project is a new plant which designed to treat organic wastes through anaerobic digestion and composting to produce the natural gas and organic fertilizers. The natural gas produced will be used for distributing in a natural gas distribution grid, and organic fertilizers will be transported to the local planting market. The proposed project uses organic wastes such as straw and livestock manure as raw materials. It is expected to treat 34,500 tons of straw and 69,000 tons of livestock manure annually, producing 3,777,800 Nm3 of the natural gas and 15,769.95 tons of solid bio-organic fertilizers. The project activities include waste pretreatment unit, anaerobic digesters unit, biogas purification unit, and organic fertilizer production workshop etc. Raw materials such as crushed straw and livestock manure are preprocessed and mixed before being sent to an anaerobic fermentation unit, where organic matter is degraded by microorganisms under anaerobic conditions. After anaerobic digestion, methane and digestate are generated. Methane will be processed through dehydration, desulfurization, decarbonization, and other processes to obtain biogas, the digestate after thorough digestion is sent to the solid-liquid separation system. The separated biogas residue is processed into solid organic fertilizer and returned to the field after being added with straw. The biogas slurry is discharged into the biogas slurry temporary storage tank for subsequent production.",4940

The project is constructed and operated by Guangxi Gangya Shengda New Energy Co., Ltd. The project started to construct on 05/03/2023 and started operation on 29/06/2023.The project has a total designed capacity 2MW (3*1MW, one is for back-up use) and combusts the organic wastewater biogas, which contains nearly 74.93% of methane, to generate electricity for Xinggui paper mill to consume. The project collects and utilizes the biogas generated by the anaerobic treatment section of organic wastewater to generate electricity, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Methane in the organic wastewater biogas has been emitted to the atmosphere since the sewage treatment station started operation. Therefore, the project avoids methane emissions and, at the same time, electricity is generated from a renewable energy source, instead of being provided by the grid. The project activity is expected to displace 14,400 MWh of electricity per year by reducing the import from the grid to the plant. VCUs will be claimed from the methane destroyed and the grid electricity displaced.
